# Artificial_Morphogen_Gradients

Source codes for the paper "Patterning and growth control in vivo by an engineered GFP gradient ". 
The codes describe the measurement and analysis of experimental data, as well as simulations and 

**Measuring_gradient_properties.ipynb**

In this notebook we measure the characteristic of the artificial gradients of the 1st part of the paper, and of the pMad gradients of the 2nd part of the paper.
The length at half maximum and the ratio of the plateau value over the maximal value are measured.

**Science-Part2_two-receptors.ipynb**

In this notebook we define the dynamics of the two-receptor artificial gradient model studied the the 2nd part of the paper. We simulate the steady state gradients for the three experimental conditions of interest (SR, SR+SR, SR+NR) and study the role of NR diffusion and handover by exploring the parameter space around the estimates provided in Supplementary Tables 2-3.
